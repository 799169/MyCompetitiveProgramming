The kth subarray is larger than or equal to k subarrays. So we binary search on the sum of the kth subarray. 
We can count subarrays with sum less or equal to K in O(N) by 2ptrs or O(NlogN) using binary search. 
Some sums don't really exist as a sub array sum but if we take the minimum possible sum it's guranteed to be in the array. 
Complexity is nlogS * logS where S is maximum sum possible around 1e15. Code here :
