	Well after dividing the first and second equation into two parts LHS and RHS we can observe that 
	all of them have the same coefficient  (1 * X1 + 2 * X2 + 3 * X3 + 4 * X4) . 

	This problem can be formulated now as follows : 
	given any set of four numbers out of 16 numbers , how many sets of four numbers are exist such that 
	having the same sum as the given set any set of four numbers also have 4! different sums 
		(as all the given numbers are distinct  ) 

	So right now we can answer the following problem : 
	given a set of 8 numbers , how many ways can we divide these 8 numbers into 
		two mutually exclusive sets of four numbers    

	In order to solve the problem for two equations after solving the above problem   
	The answer will be the summation of choosing any set of 8 numbers and multiply its 
		number of ways by number of ways of the other 8 numbers  
		
	This step actually depends on your solution  you may traverse all the possible combination of 8 numbers
	 out of 16 but in this case you'll have to divide your answer by two as you've computed 
	 (A * B) & (B * A) or you can just visit each one of them once


Notes from Tran Loc
- This is an old fact, but I just note here for myself, that is, 
	''the last EOL character in the output'' problem when using UVA. This one problem will cost submissions.
- I used uDebug, and I got 2 test cases that is that different than mines, but I still submited my solution and got AC anyway. 
	Is that solution on uDebug correct??
- At the first glance, I had this observation too, that is, for any set of 4 different number, we will have 4! different sums. 
	This observation IS WRONG, here is one case: for the set {87, 97, 78, 59}, 
	we have 1 * 87 + 2 * 78 + 3 * 97 + 4 * 59 = 770 and 1 * 87 + 2 * 97 + 3 * 59 + 4 * 78 = 770.
