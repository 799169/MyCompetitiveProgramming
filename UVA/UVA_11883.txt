Floyd
	Mohamed Anany: get the shortest path from the source to all nodes and the same for the destination you can do that using floyd or dijkstra
	 then grab each edge, now it's easy enough to see that the cost is the minimal of 
	 dist[1][u] + dist[v][n] + (v[i]/f(x)) where f(x) = a[i] ^ x over all edges, now the thing that was just the result intuition 
	 that f(x) is actually a Concave function so we can easily ternary search on the x.
