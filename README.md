# MyCompetitiveProgramming

## What
* This repository is mainly used as part of my [online coaching](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/59131).
* The repository contains mini-editorials/notes written by my trainees for some problems in several OJs (UVA, SPOJ, LiveArchive, Timus, etc).
  * I always ask my trainees to explain how they solved the problem, hence I know how they approached it and also I can circulate these notes among others.
  * Specifically, when there are more than one mini-editorials per a problem, I create a file for it. Otherwise, I keep the link in my private notes. I will try to post these ones in the future.
* The same also for the IOI and OI problems (CEOI, Baltic, Balkan, APIO, etc).
* I searched and organized many of the **web official editorials/solutions** for IOI/OI to make it easier for my trainees.
* The content of this repository will grow up more by time.


## Motivation
* Many problems have high quality, but no editorials for them (or even no online solutions). I try to make it easier for my trainees.
  * Training on high quality/interesting problems is much more fun and saves trainees time from solving repetitive ideas.
* Official contest sites typically disappear after some time, as a result, the official solutions/editorials are not accessible. I am trying to organize them in a single place.


## Future Release
* In the future, I might release 2 Google Docs sheets of problems, one for ICPC/OJs and the other for IOI/OI problems.
* Indexing many of (interesting to solve) problems.
  * I always ask my trainees to inform me how interesting the problem is. I use this input as a signal.
* For each problem: Link, Category, Level, How interesting, Mini-Editorial/Solution.

## Request
* If you know about official solutions/editorials for ICPC/IOI/OI/Others or new ones are released, email me to add them (mostafa.saad.fci@gmail.com)
