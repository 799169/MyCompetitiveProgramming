Mohamed Nasser Ali Formula for permutations without repetitions is just N!/a1!*a2!*an1 where a1,a2 are repetitions for each character. 
Now we need to calculate the last non zero digit. Now let's do a prime factorization of N!, and keep track each prime frequency 
in the array. Now iterate over denominators, doing the same but instead subtract from the frequency array ( Since we are dividng). 
We now have the desired number in the form of it's prime factorization, but we need the last non zero digit, but notice that 0's only 
come from 2 * 5, so if we divide by min(f[2],f[5]], we will get a number with no zeros, do that to the array, and then calculate each 
prime term as modPow(prime,frequency,10), and multiply them with each other modulo 10. Code here :
