This is the largest empty rectangle problem: Given binary matrix, find the max sub-rect with all zeros
	If N = 100, we can use the general maximum sub-rectangle algorithm DP O(N^3) 
	The special case here, the data is just binary, so how we could solve it?
	
	Notice:
		Sometimes input is 2D array with pos (x, y) to mark a cell 
		Sometimes input is 2D plane of points (x, y)
