Statement in English.
There are n volunteers, in the beginning they are standing in row.
M-people (in increasing order) choose some [l;r] people in the row, delete them, becoming their chief, and then stand in their place.
It continues until there is only one person left.
K-people do the same.
There is a conflict situation if an m-person and a k-person are both chiefs of a specific volunteer (probably not straight chief).
For every m-person, one has to find how many k-people he is in conflict situation with.
The answer is sum of those numbers.
