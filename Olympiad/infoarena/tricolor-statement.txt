	Problem: 
	Given a tree with n nodes, color the tree nodes in black or white so that the number of (unordered) pairs of twin nodes is maximum.
	Two nodes are twinned if and only if both are white and either are bound directly by an edge, or the single elemental chain of them contains
	only black nodes
