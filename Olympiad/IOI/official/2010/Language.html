The nature of this problem is innovative within the IOI.
Its purpose is to bring the field of <em>information retrieval</em>
under the attention.
This problem is discussed in detail in the book
<cite>Information Retrieval: Implementing and Evaluating Search Engines</cite>
by S. Büttcher, C.L.A. Clarke, and G.V. Cormack
(MIT Press, to appear soon).
Especially see Chapter 10 on Categorization and Filtering.
<p>

One important observation is that excerpts from the same language version
of Wikipedia will share some characteristics in a statistical sense.
Because many random excerpts are offered,
the variability between excerpts from the same language
play a negligible role.
It has been confirmed that the statistical resemblance between
the provided test input and the official grader input is highly
predictable.

</p><p>
Note that because of the random re-coding of the language codes and
symbol codes,
there is no opportunity to hard code any specific (personal) language
knowledge into a solution.

</p><p>
There are many approaches possible.
<em>Rocchio's method</em>, which was informally described in
the task description,
suffices to solve Subtask 1.

</p><p>
For Subtask 2,
one needs to do more than simply look at symbol frequencies.
Collecting statistics on <em>bigrams</em> (pairs of neighboring symbols),
<em>trigrams</em> (three consecutive symbols) will yield higher accuracies.
