<p>
This is known to be a hard problem.
No general polynomial algorithm is known for this problem, that is,
no algorithm has been discovered
that is guaranteed to solve each problem instance in a time polynomial
in the size of the problem (area of the corn field).
</p><p>
This is also the reason why this task was offered as an output-only task,
where the contestants were given 10 specific instances (corn fields) to tackle.
They could do this by hand, or write programs to analyze these mazes, and
write yet other programs (potentially, a different program for each field)
to produce a long(est) path.
Note that the path need not be optimal;
points could also be scored for (good) approximations.
</p><p>
Here are some characteristics and results by Tor Myklebust (HSC member)
for the 10 instances that the contestants had to tackle:
