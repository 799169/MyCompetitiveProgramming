This was intended to be a very easy task.
The number of features to be determined (murderer, location, weapon),
and the number of options for each feature were intentionally fixed,
and not parameterized.

</p><p>
Given that there are 6 candidate murderers, 10 candidate locations,
and 6 candidate weapons,
there is a total of 6*10*6=360 theories.
</p><p>
Subtask 1 could be solved by trying each possible theory
(three nested <code>for</code> loops).
</p><p>
Because the response to a refuted theory will identify one feature
for which a wrong option was guessed,
the search can be expedited.
All theories having that wrong option for that particular feature
are now ruled out.
</p><p>
Subtask 2 can be solved by a single loop,
incrementing whichever feature was wrong (a monotonic search).
The total number of options equals 6+10+6=22, and
the last option not ruled out must be correct
(it was given that there is exactly one correct theory).
Therefore, at most 22-3=19 refuted calls to <b>Theory</b> are needed.
One confirming call to <b>Theory</b> was required,
so a total of 20 calls suffices.
</p><p>
Here is a Pascal solution that can readily be generalized
(the constant, type, and auxiliary function definitions could be eliminated,
but they document the relevant concepts nicely):
</p><pre>const
  NFeatures = 3; { number of features }
  Confirmed = 0; { result when theory is confirmed }

type
  TFeature = 1 .. NFeatures;
  TOption = 1 .. MaxInt; { value for a feature }
  TTheory = array [ TFeature ] of TOption;
  TResult = Confirmed .. NFeatures;

function TestTheory(T: TTheory): TResult;
  begin TestTheory := Theory(T[1], T[2], T[3]) end;

procedure Solve;
  var
    T: TTheory = (6, 10, 6); { candidate theory }
    i: TResult; { result of TestTheory(T) }
  begin
    repeat
      i := TestTheory(T)
    ; if i &lt;&gt; Confirmed then { T refuted } T[i] := T[i] - 1
    until i = Confirmed
    { T confirmed }
  end;
</pre>

In C, without constant and type definitions, it could look like this:
<pre>void Solve() {
   int T[] = {0, 6, 10, 6}; // candidate theory, ignore T[0]
   int i; // result of Theory
   do {
     i = Theory(T[1], T[2], T[3]);
     if (i != 0) --T[i];
   } while (i != 0);
}
</pre>
