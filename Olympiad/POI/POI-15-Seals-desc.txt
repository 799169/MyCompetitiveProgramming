		we have two grids and we need to make any number of copies from second grid
		to fill the first grid without fill an cell with x for more than one time
		and without rotating the grid and without fill cell which is outside first
		cell.

		explanation of sample test cases : 
		first test case :
		3 4 4 2
		xx..   starting of first grid
		.xx.
		xx..   ending of first grid
		x.     starting of second grid
		.x
		x. 
		..     ending of second grid
		so we can make two copies from second grid to fill first grid.
		first copy : 
		1x..
		.1x.
		1x.
		second copy : 
		12..
		.12.
		12..
		so we fill all x cells in first grid using copies of second grid without
		violating the rules above so answer is TAK (Yes).
		second test case : 
		2 2 2 2
		xx      starting of first grid
		xx      ending of first grid
		.x      starting of second grid
		x.      ending of second gird
		so first copy :
		x1
		1x
		we can't make second copy without rotating second grid or fill point outside
		first grid so answer is NIE (NO).
