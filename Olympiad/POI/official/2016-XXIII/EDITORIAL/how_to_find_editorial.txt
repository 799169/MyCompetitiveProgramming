POI Editorials are in Polish. File typically > 1 Mega, so can't translate directly using Google Translate
	I divided the polish editorial to several files (p1, p2, ..)
	Problem names according to translation are listed in each file, in order
		Sometimes, the Doc Translate is not accurate than box translate!
		If this is the case, you will find (problem name - code)
		So items format below is <Translated name> [Actual name - Actual code]
		
	Once realized which file will have the editorial
		Go to Doc translator: https://translate.google.ca/#view=home&op=translate&sl=pl&tl=en
		Upload the pdf
		Search using the translated name.
