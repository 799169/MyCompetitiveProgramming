This file lists which test cases should each program pass:
seq.cpp: 1-20 (100%) - O(n) solution
seqs1.cpp: 1-6 (30%) - O(n^3) solution
seqs2.cpp: 1-10 (50%) - O(n^2) solution
seqs3.cpp: 1-10, 11, 12, 14, 15 (70%) - optimized O(n^2) solution
seqs4.cpp: 1-10, 11, 13, 14, 15 (70%) - another optimized O(n^2) solution
seqb1.cpp: 1-5, 7, 9, 15 (40%) - O(n) solution that forgets about using 64-bit integers
seqb2.cpp: 1, 2, 11, 13 (20%) - O(n) greedy but incorrect solution
seqb3.cpp: 1, 4, 11, 12 (20%) - another O(n) greedy but incorrect solution
