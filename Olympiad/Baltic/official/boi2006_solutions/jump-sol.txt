BOI 2006

Task Name: Jump
Task Title: Jump the Board!

Spoiler:
This task is a pretty classical one.  You should go for it with Dynamic Programming. 
However, the number limitation is such that you need to implement your own bignums to solve all test cases.  

Test cases such that 
- about one third of the total score can be achieved with a recursive solution.
- about another third can be achieved with a DP solution using 32-bit integers
- the last third can only be achieved with a DP solution and a bignum implementation  
  (that means, this third should not be achieved with a 64-bit integer like it might be offered by the 
  compiler or the STL available).
