Problem
	Link: https://cses.fi/107/list/
	
	If you need to register: https://cses.fi/register
	
	If sample is hard to understand: https://github.com/zoooma13/Competitive-Programming/blob/master/beetles_sample.txt
		note that initially the beetle is at position 0

		example input :
		 3 15
		 6 -3 1
		output : 
		 25

		explanation : 
		 there are 3 water drops each holdig 15 units of water
		 their positions are -3 ,1 ,6

		possible paths of the beetle : 

		 beetle moves to 1 then 6 then -3 
		 0 -> 1 -> 6 -> -3
			  14 + 9  +  0 = 25 
			 
		 beetle moves to -3 then 1 then 6
		 0 -> -3 -> 1 -> 6
			  12 +  8  + 3 = 23
			 
		 beetle moves to 1 then -3 then 6
		 0 -> 1 -> -3 -> 6
			  14 + 10  + 1 = 25

		so the maximum amount of water the beetle can drink is 25 units
